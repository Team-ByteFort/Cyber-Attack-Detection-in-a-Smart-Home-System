To analyze incoming requests for patterns indicating attacks in a Smart Home System, we need to implement an anomaly detection system that identifies suspicious activities based on specified criteria (rate checks, value checks, and role-aware filtering), along with two additional anomaly detection functions. The system must differentiate authorized high-frequency requests from potential attacks using context parameters like user roles and handle logging and alerting for suspicious events. Below is a comprehensive solution implemented in Python.

### Approach

#### Anomaly Detection Functions
1. **Rate Checks**
   - **Failed Login Attempts**: Flag if more than 5 failed attempts occur within 1 minute.
   - **Abnormal Frequency of Control Commands**: Flag if more than 10 on/off commands occur within 30 seconds, with adjustments for authorized roles.

2. **Value Checks**
   - **Power Consumption**: Flag readings that are negative, zero (where invalid), or exceed 150% of the historical average.

3. **Role-Aware Filtering**
   - Increase thresholds for ADMIN or MANAGER roles during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM) to allow normal bursts.

4. **Additional Anomaly Detection Functions**
   - **Unusual Device Access Patterns**: Flag when a user accesses a device they don’t typically use.
   - **Suspicious Command Sequences**: Flag predefined attack-related command sequences (e.g., disabling an alarm followed by unlocking a door).

#### Differentiation Between Authorized Requests and Attacks
- Use role privileges and time context to adjust thresholds for high-frequency actions.
- Assume authenticated requests include user role information to assess legitimacy.

#### Logging and Alerting
- Log all events and anomalies in a JSON file with timestamps, request details, and user info.
- Mark log entries with an "alert" flag when anomalies are detected.

### Implementation

The following Python code implements this anomaly detection system:
`smart_home_anomaly_detection.py`

### Explanation

#### Rate Checks
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Uses a `deque` to track timestamps within a 1-minute window. Flags if count exceeds 5.
- **Control Command Frequency**: Tracks commands per user and device within 30 seconds. Threshold is 10 normally, but 20 for ADMIN/MANAGER during business hours.

#### Value Checks
- **Power Consumption**: Maintains a rolling list of the last 100 readings per device. Flags negative/zero values or readings >150% of the average.

#### Role-Aware Filtering
- Adjusts the control command rate threshold for ADMIN/MANAGER roles during 9 AM - 5 PM, allowing authorized bursts.

#### Additional Anomaly Detection
- **Unusual Device Access**: Compares the accessed device against a user’s pre-populated device set. Flags if not found.
- **Command Sequences**: Tracks recent commands per user and flags predefined suspicious sequences (e.g., `disable_alarm` → `unlock_door` within 10 seconds).

#### Differentiation
- Uses `role` in events to adjust thresholds for authorized high-frequency actions by ADMIN/MANAGER during business hours.
- Assumes events are authenticated, providing role context. In a real system, active session validation could be added.

#### Logging and Alerting
- Logs all events and anomalies to `anomaly_log.json` in JSON Lines format.
- Each entry includes a timestamp, event details, anomalies (if any), and an `alert` flag set to `true` when anomalies are detected.

### Usage
- Run the script to process the simulated events.
- Check `anomaly_log.json` for logged events and flagged anomalies.
- Extend the `state["user_profiles"]` and `SUSPICIOUS_SEQUENCES` as needed for your specific Smart Home System.

This solution provides a robust framework to detect anomalies, differentiate authorized actions, and log suspicious events effectively.
